# osu-FailedRankScreen
Sends osu! to the ranking screen, even when failed. 

Ever had a play where you *almost* passed that really hard part? Or maybe you did 
pass that super hard part, but failed at the end? Or maybe you just like incomplete 
replays, who knows. Whatever you want, this program allows you to save those failed 
replays as long as you didn't ragequit the "failed" screen.

## Why?
Because peppy doesn't allow you to save failed replays. I have no clue why he doesn't add this, but with this program you can now.

## Usage
1. Play badly and fail a map.
2. Run the program and get sent to the ranking screen.
3. Press F2 inside osu! to save the failed replay.

## Notes
Even though the replay wasn't complete, osu! will usually play the whole map but 
with the cursor frozen in place. I don't think I can fix this, especially without 
writing replay files myself.
